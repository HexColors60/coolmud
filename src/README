src/		- source for COOLMUD
bin/		- contains the source for COOL databases.  also where the
		  the COOLMUD executables are placed.

To install coolmud:

1)  Type "make".
    That should be all you need to do to compile the source.  The
    Makefile will:
    1.1)  Run the gnu configure script in the current directory,
	  automatically configuring the Makefiles for your system.
    1.2)  cd to the src directory, and make the bin/cm executable.
    1.3)  cd to the bin directory, and make the database files.

2)  Start the server by typing
	./cm <dbaseprefix>
    For example,
	./cm west
    The server will look for <prefix>.db, <prefix>.dir, <prefix>.pag, and
    <prefix>.cfg.  <prefix>.cfg should contain the names of any remote
    servers, plus cache configuration parameters.  (You may also use the
    'restart' shell script to start cm; see bin/restart).

If step 1.2 fails, you may need to edit src/Makefile or src/config.h
for your system.

If step 1.3 fails, you may need to edit bin/Makefile for your system.
If working correctly, bin/Makefile will create three files for each
database:  a .db, .dir and .pag file.  COOLMUD uses a dbm-format dbase. 

NOTE:  It's normal to see the message "SYS_OBJ:  #0 not found"
twice in the compilation of each database.

WARNING:  New versions of COOLMUD may not have compatible .db formats.
Therefore, if you want to update your server to a new version, do a
flatfile dump of the database with the *old* version of the server, eg:
    ./cm west -d west.dump
Then recompile the server, and reload the dumpfile with the new version:
    ./cm west -f west.dump

COOLMUD has been successfully compiled under SunOS 4.1, Ultrix 4.2,
BSD, Linux, Dynix/PTX, Irix and HPUX, and on MicroVAX-II,
DECsystem5000, Sparc, 386, 486, Sequent, Iris Indigo and NeXT
architectures.

If you make any changes or plan to redistribute the source to
COOLMUD, _check the COPYRIGHT and COPYING files first_.

Bug reports should:

o   contain the COOLMUD version number, machine architecture, operating
    system, and conditions of error.
o   consist of a stack trace from dbx or gdb.
o   be sent to sfwhite@sciborg.uwaterloo.ca, with 'COOLMUD' in the
    Subject: line.
o   be descriptive.  The more information you give me, the better chance
    I have of finding and fixing the bug.
