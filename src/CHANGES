This is version 2.2.0 of COOLMUD.  This file lists changes since version
2.1.5.  Quite a few new features have been added in this version, so
this should be considered a beta release.  For stability, you should
probably stick to v2.1.5.

    the creation and connection of players, and are called by the
    new method SYS_OBJ.parse.
